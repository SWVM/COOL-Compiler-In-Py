# Parser
## Notes
- based on [PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html)

## To run
- py parser.py input_file.cl
- py test_cases/test_script.py


## known issues
- output file name: fname.cl-ast-test
- PLY yacc actually takes input from other classes that mimics the Lexer, [here](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn36)
